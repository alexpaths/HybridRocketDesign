# HybridRocketDesign
Nitrous/HTPB Rocket Analysis Code for MATLAB/Octave

This code was written for my senior project at CalPoly San Luis Obispo. It was also the third hybrid rocket I ever built. Results from this project were published in the AIAA 2011 Joint Propulsion Conference paper reference number AIAA-2011-5676
